~~Currently, I'm a Cryptography Engineer at the
[Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/)
working on formally verified post-quantum cryptographic implementations as part of the
[Formosa Crypto](https://formosa-crypto.org/)
project.~~

Before that, I did my BSc in Software Engineering at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN)
and my MSc in Information Security at the [Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/fcup/en/)
where I wrote my Masterâ€™s thesis on
[*Speculative Execution Resilient Cryptography*](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/152745/2/641114.pdf).
