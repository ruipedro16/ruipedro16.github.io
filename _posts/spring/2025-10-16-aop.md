AOP solves the following two problems by modularizing *cross-cutting concerns* (e.g. logging, security)
into separate *aspects*, thus reducing code duplication.

<!-- FIXME: TODO: Dont say intermixed or interwoven -->

- **Code Scattering**: the code for a single cross-cutting concern is replicated across
multiple, often unrelated, modules or classes.
- **Code Tangling**: the code for multiple, distinct concerns is intermixed or interwoven within a
single module or class, making the module difficult to understand, maintain, and update.

### Terminology

- **Join Point**: A point in the executionof a program (e.g. method call, exception thrown).
- **Poincut**: An expression that selects one or more Joint Points.
- **Advice**: Code to be executed at each selected Joint Point.
- **Aspect**: Module that encapsulates pointcuts and advice.
- **Weaving**: Technique by weach aspects are combined with the main code.

#### Example: Tracking property changes with context

- The `JointPoint` parameter provides context about the intercepted point.
- In `point.getTarget()`, the name of the bean is returned because, on the
bean implementation, the `toString()` method returns the bean-name.

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class PropertyChangeTracker {
    private Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass());

    @Before("execution(void set*(*))")
    public void trackChange(JointPoint point) {
        String methodName = point.getSignature().getName();
        Object newValue = point.getArgs()[0];
        Logger.info(methodName + " about to change to " + 
            newValue + " on " + point.getTarget());
    }
}
```
